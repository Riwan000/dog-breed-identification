# End-to-End Dog Breed Classification

This project implements an end-to-end multi-class dog breed classifier using TensorFlow 2.0 and TensorFlow Hub. The model identifies the breed of a dog from its image, leveraging deep learning techniques such as transfer learning for classification across 120 dog breeds.

## Introduction
Dog breed identification is a challenging problem due to the large variety of breeds and the subtle differences between them. This project aims to classify dog breeds using deep learning, building a multi-class classifier trained on Kaggle's Dog Breed Identification dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from the [Kaggle Dog Breed Identification Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification). It contains over 10,000 images for training, with 120 different dog breeds as labels.

To use this project, download the dataset from Kaggle and unzip it into the working directory.

## Evaluation
The model is evaluated by predicting probabilities for each dog breed in the test set, with a focus on high accuracy across all classes. The Kaggle competition's evaluation metric can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/overview/evaluation).

## Model Architecture
- **Framework**: TensorFlow 2.0
- **Transfer Learning**: TensorFlow Hub is used for feature extraction.
- **Base Model**: Pretrained models such as ResNet or Inception may be used.
- **Custom Layers**: The final classification layers are fine-tuned for 120 dog breeds.
- **Data Input**: Images are converted to tensors for training and testing.

The model architecture is designed for image classification and utilizes a pre-trained model to extract relevant features, which are passed through custom layers for dog breed classification.

## Results
The classifier achieves a significant accuracy in identifying different dog breeds. Here is an example of predictions:

| Dog Image         | Predicted Breed   | Confidence |
|-------------------|-------------------|------------|
| Golden Retriever  | Golden Retriever  | 95%        |
| Labrador Retriever| Labrador Retriever| 93%        |
| Husky             | Alaskan Malamute  | 87%        |
